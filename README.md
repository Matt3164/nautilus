This project is a compilation of functions/utilities/data structure that I used during my ML experiments.

# Main idea

The main interface relies on numpy arrays and the wonderful sklearn API especially pipeline.

The main goal is to combine the power of `cv2`, `skimage` and `sklearn` to beat deep learning approaches.

# Examples

You can find meaningful examples in `examples/fashion_mnist/` on how to use image processing and pipelines together

# Additional notes

Library containing a list of utilities used in kaggle projects.


# Todo list

- [ ] Work on harder use cases such cat detection and face detection
- [ ] Pytest
- [ ] Pypy deployment
- [ ] Update Trello and roadmap
- [ ] pip/conda package
- [ ] Colab deployment
